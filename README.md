# 🦂 Scorpio – Terminal Chatbot AI

**Scorpio** is a terminal-powered AI chatbot that provides intelligent responses to user queries, simulating a natural text-based conversation in your command line. Built using Node.js and powered by language generation logic, it’s a clean, extendable base for terminal AI bots.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Learned how to integrate and use Google's Gemini API with Node.js to generate intelligent text responses in a terminal interface.
- Gained hands-on experience with command-line argument parsing, API calling, async functions, and JSON handling in a Node.js environment.
- Improved understanding of chatbot logic, Markdown formatting, and how to document terminal-based projects effectively on GitHub.
